### Why static IP? ###
If DHCP is not working (=wifi cannot connect to your access point), you might need to setup IP manually:<br><br>

<h3>Wi-Fi static IP setup:</h3>
<ul><li>go on Wireless & networks > Wi-fi settings<br>
</li><li>click Home button > Advanced > Use static IP<br>
</li><li>add an IP and the rest of setings from your network range,click back button and that's it.
